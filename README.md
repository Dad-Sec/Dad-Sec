## 🧭 About Me

I’m a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, cybersecurity professional, and founder of a Semper Secured Solutions a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) based in rural Alaska. My career has taken me through some of the harshest environments physically, mentally, and professionally, but every obstacle sharpened my resolve and gave me the tools to create lasting impact through technology.

After two combat tours, years in law enforcement, and leading logistics operations in the Alaskan oil fields, I pivoted into cybersecurity to help secure the digital frontier. Now, I’m channeling that grit and real-world experience into building scalable, secure IT solutions that empower underserved communities including veterans and remote workers.

Through hands-on home lab projects, self-hosted environments, and continuous learning, I’m proving that innovation isn’t born from comfort rather it’s forged in adversity.
